<a href="http://tostring.it/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/ASP.NET_Web_API_Succinctly_download.png"><img class="size-medium wp-image-847 alignleft" style="margin: 5px;" alt="ASP.NET_Web_API_Succinctly_download" src="http://tostring.it/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/ASP.NET_Web_API_Succinctly_download-290x300.png" width="290" height="300" /></a>In the past week, my friend <a title="Emanuele Del Bono's blog" href="http://ema.codiceplastico.com/" target="_blank">Emanuele Del Bono</a> (Ema for all people who know him) announced his first tech book about ASP.NET Web API.

Who follow me knows that I’m a HTTP addicted, so I love everything around web development, starting from websites but also including APIs, especially if developed using WEB API (I wrote several posts about that framework).

<a title="Syncfusion official web site" href="http://www.syncfusion.com/?UTM_medium=lattanziblogreview" target="_blank">Syncfusion</a> published the book in the usual (cool IMHO) format: a free, small e –book (it’s just 90 pages).

Personally, I am not a fan of big books, especially if they are tech book. The reason is pretty simple: I don’t have so much time to read so, when I completed the chapter number 15 of a book with 800 pages, probably the arguments/frameworks of the book are already out of date.

About the author I can’t spend so much words, Ema is a cooler and smart developer and he was a speaker when I participate for the first time to a conference as attendee (don’t remember the year, but was about localization in C# and he showed an application with “Bresciano”, strange Italian dialect :-)).

If you need more detail, of course there are several cool blog posts around the web, but I suggest to keep in touch with that blog <a href="http://webapibloggers.com/">http://webapibloggers.com/</a> (is an aggregate of the cooler Web API Bloggers, included me :D).

What’s next?
Start read this super cool book downloading it from <a href="http://www.syncfusion.com/resources/techportal/ebooks/webapi?UTM_medium=lattanziblogreview" target="_blank">here</a>.
