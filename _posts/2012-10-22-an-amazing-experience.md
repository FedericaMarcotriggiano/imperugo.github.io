<span style="line-height: 1.5em;">Yesterday something special is happened and I still cannot believe that the <a href="http://webnetconf.eu" target="_blank">Web.Net European Conference</a> is over.</span>
For me was the first conference as a promoter and it was an <strong>AMAZING experience</strong>. More than <strong>160 people from 11 different countries</strong> in the same building speaking about the future of the web (how F*ing cool is that?).

The atmosphere was really cool and I met some incredible speakers. <a title="Rui Carvalho" href="http://www.rui.fr/" target="_blank">Rui</a> had a wonderful speech about <a href="http://webnetconf.eu/#/Home/SessionDetails/14" target="_blank">tiny frameworks</a>, <a title="Massimiliano Mantione" href="https://twitter.com/m_a_s_s_i" target="_blank">Massimiliano</a> has hypnotized all people with <a href="http://webnetconf.eu/#/Home/SessionDetails/3" target="_blank">his magic on JavaScript</a>, <a title="Alessandro Giorgetti" href="http://www.primordialcode.com/" target="_blank">Alessandro</a> shocked his room using <a href="http://webnetconf.eu/#/Home/SessionDetails/2" target="_blank">WebSockets and SignalR</a>, <a title="Raffaele Rialdi" href="http://www.iamraf.net/" target="_blank">Raf</a> with <a href="http://webnetconf.eu/#/Home/SessionDetails/6" target="_blank">TypeScript and WebAPI</a> and the same happened with the others speakers (unfortunately I cannot see other sessions because the organization made me very busy).

What more? A very nice <a href="https://twitter.com/camassey" target="_blank">Chris Massey</a>!

Another incredible news is the conference drop. <strong>There were 165 people on 173 available sits</strong>, we are almost “dropless” and for me that means “ok the conference is really cool, keep on working”.

We are thinking to replicate the conference somewhere in the Europe (probably during the spring), but one thing is for sure, <strong>next year we will still be here</strong>.

You rock!
