<span style="line-height: 1.5em;">As you probably know I’m organizing with <a title="Simone Chiaretta's blog" href="http://codeclimber.net.nz/" target="_blank">Simone Chiaretta</a> the <a title="Web European Conference" href="http://webnetconf.eu" target="_blank"><strong>Web European Conference</strong></a> in Milan</span>.
We opened the Call For Paper almost one month ago and we got more than 30 sessions. <strong>There are only 4 days to submit your proposals</strong>.

There will be 5 tracks (JavaScript, .NET server-side frameworks, non .NET server-side frameworks, CMSes, Cloud) for a total of 19 talks of 1 hour, and when the conference closes the hackathon will start.

Do you have something cool to share? Send you title and abstract <a title="Web European Conference" href="http://webnetconf.eu/" target="_blank">here</a>!

If you are a web addicted you can’t miss that appointment! Next week you can vote the proposal.

<strong>Stay tuned and submit your prosal!</strong>
