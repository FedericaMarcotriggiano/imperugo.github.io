Recently I've been writing and reading lots of articles/tweets about [OWIN](http://owin.org/) and its implementation [Katana](https://katanaproject.codeplex.com/).

The reason is pretty simple, I'm writing a book with [Simone Chiaretta](http://codeclimber.net.nz/) about OWIN for [Syncfusion](http://www.syncfusion.com/).
The book is part of their “[Succinctly](http://www.syncfusion.com/resources/techportal/ebooks)” e-book series, so nothing big and complicated, just all you need to know about OWIN/Katana and how to use them in your application.

For this reason we are really focused on OWIN. In the meantime, our friend [Rui Carvalho](http://www.rui.fr/) organized a super cool conference in Paris named [NCrafts](http://ncrafts.io/).

It is "dangerous" combo because the conference looks really amazing and I'll speak with Simone about OWIN :-)

All jokes aside, the conference will be really awesome (Web, Cloud, Data and so on) so, if you don't have anything planned for the 16 May, hurry up and come to Paris (all the conference info is [here](http://ncrafts.io/)).

I'd like to finish the post with a quote from the NCrafts web site:

>In other words, we love building software with art, passion and technology and share with everyone.
