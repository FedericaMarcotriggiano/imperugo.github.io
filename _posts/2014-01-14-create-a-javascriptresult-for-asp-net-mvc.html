<p><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">One pillar of ASP.NET MVC is the extensibility. It means you can add whatever you want wherever you want (or something like that).</span></p>

<p>Like all frameworks, ASP.NET MVC does not cover all features requested by developers, but offers the opportunity to create your own logic. That means extensibility.</p>

<p>In my case, the goal was to render a partial view into a JavaScript file.</p>

<p>Before to see how you can do that, it’s important to understand what does really mean “render a partial view into a Javascript file”.</p>

<p>In this example I want to create a simple HTML including the base info for a user profile (Firstname, Lastname and website).</p>

<p>The HTML Looks like this.</p>

{% gist  8417605 ViewSample.html %}

Render that HTML into a JavaScript means encoding everything and putting it into a document write. The result should looks like this.</p>

{% gist  8417605 OutputExample.js %}

<p>In MVC all requests need a Controller and an Action, which must return something that could be an HTML, json or javascript (in my case).</p>

<p>To do this, the first thing to do is create a JavascriptResult (and his extension method) like that:</p>

{% gist  8417605 JavascriptResult.cs %}
{% gist  8417605 ExtensionMethod.cs %}

<p>As you can see the code is really simple, I render the partial into a string, encode the content and return it changing the content type.</p>

<p>Now you are able to use the following code:</p>

{% gist  8417605 ControllerExample.cs %}

<p>The last thing to do is to render the partial view into another site, so you have to include your JavaScript like a normal resource.</p>

{% gist  8417605 UsageExample.html %}

<p>In the screenshot below you can see how a client site (not the site that hosts the controller) shows the partial.</p>

<p><a href="{{ site.url }}/assets/2014/01/JavascriptResult.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-869" alt="JavascriptResult" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/2014/01/JavascriptResult-300x158.jpg" width="300" height="158" /></a></p>

&nbsp;

<p>What is cool about that approach is about server side technology. Because we are returning a Javascript file the client could be a simple .html static page or something generated with nodejs or whatever you want.</p>

<p>Is it cool?</p>
