Finally I created my English blog. It took me almost a year to finish the setup and convince myself that I can have an English blog. This isn’t my first adventure like a blogger, my followers know my Italian blog, and now it’s time to share my passion with “non” Italian people.

My “history” is really simple, in few words <strong>I’m a web addicted</strong>, it means I love all dev stuff around the World Wide Web. Moreover if want to know more about me, <a title="About me" href="http://override.tostring.it/about-me/" target="_blank">here</a> there is my story and <a title="CV" href="http://override.tostring.it/cv/" target="_blank">here</a> there are my jobs.

Moreover I’m the founder of <a title="Dexter Blog Engine" href="http://dexterblogengine.codeplex.com/" target="_blank">Dexter</a>, a blog engine totally based on ASP.NET MVC. Unluckily a build is not ready, so I’m using Wordpress for this blog hoping to migrate as soon as possible.

As you understood this blog is a tech blog and probably you are asking yourself - “Another tech blog?”

The answer is absolutely YES for two reasons:
<ul>
	<li>First because this <strong>isn’t only a blog</strong>;</li>
	<li>Second because my English really sucks and <strong>you’ll feel happy</strong> to read my horrible language errors J.</li>
</ul>
Anyway this blog will not be a clone of my Italian, probably I’ll translate some posts but not all. If you want to keep yourself update subscribe my <a title="My Rss Feed" href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/override/tostring/it" target="_blank">rss feed</a>. Moreover I’m active on twitter, so follow <a title="Imperugo on Twitter" href="http://twitter.com/imperugo" target="_blank">me</a> and subscribe my newsletter to have every week my linkfloods.

As usual, your feedback and comments are more than welcome.Thank you in advance
