Here we go! We have some great news about the <a href="http://webnetconf.eu/">Web.net European Conference</a> that me and <a href="http://codeclimber.net.nz/">Simone Chiaretta</a> are organizing.

Web.net it’s a conference totally based on the latest web technologies so, <strong>ASP.NET MVC</strong>, <strong>Node JS</strong>, <strong>Advanced JavaScript</strong>, <strong>REST</strong>, <strong>HTML5</strong>, <strong>more and more</strong>.
Finally we have a date, <strong>20 October 2012 in Milan</strong>, save the date!

The conference will be in <strong><a href="http://www.avanade.com/it-it/Pages/default.aspx" target="_blank">Avanade Italy</a></strong> that offers the location and coffee break, its Headquarter is <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;source=s_q&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;q=Avanade+Italy,+Milano&amp;sll=50.838631,4.386157&amp;sspn=0.008781,0.017209&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;hq=Avanade+Italy,&amp;hnear=Milan,+Lombardy,+Italy&amp;ll=45.482732,9.205341&amp;spn=0.009749,0.017209&amp;z=16" target="_blank">near Milano Central Railway Station</a> that should be comfortable for all attendees.

Another important thing is about the sponsors. We have important sponsors that are collaborating with us.
<strong><a title="GreenbBubble" href="http://www.greenbubble.it" target="_blank">Greenbubble</a> </strong>is working for the conference site, logo and so on. <strong><a href="http://github.com/" target="_blank">Github</a> </strong>will offers a beer after the conference for all attendees (an amazing geek time to discuss about our favorite technologies) and <a href="http://umbraco.org/" target="_blank"><strong>Umbraco</strong></a>.

Another important news is that we have the first official speaker. <strong><a title="Ayende" href="http://ayende.com" target="_blank">Ayende</a> </strong>will speak about <strong><a href="http://ravendb.net/" target="_blank">RavenDB</a> </strong>in the Web environment and offers 30% discount to all attendees for the <strong>RavenDB Italian Bootcamp</strong> (22 october, two days after the conference).

As you can see there are many cool stuff, if you are not registered, <a title="Web.net Conference" href="http://webnetconf.eu/" target="_blank">DO IT HERE</a>!
