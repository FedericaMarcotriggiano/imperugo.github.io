In the latest period I used Wordpress for my blog, but really I never liked it. There are several reason, it was too slow, sometimes the update fails, plugin updates, server backup and so on.

In the past year I created a blog engine (never completed) base on .NET technologies, it's name is Dexter and i available on Github.
From my point of view it was better than Wordpress, but with many of the problems mentioned above.

Some weeks ago, David Ebbo synthesized in this [post](http://blog.davidebbo.com/2014/01/moving-to-github-pages.html)  my idea of blog engine (**for a nerd of course**)

So, everything is started from there, i migrated first my [italian blog](http://imperugo.tostring.it), than this blog.

Jekyll is cool! It creates static files (simple .html) with the pagination structure, custom pages and permalinks.
Of course you can'd do some stuff like comments and search. 
I think that's not a problem, beacuse there are several external services for that, in my case Disqus for comments and Google for search.

The last part of migration is Github. It offers a free host based on a git repository. The only thing to do is to create a repo name username.github.io and push your pages.
After few minutes, your pages are available
